# Mineral Classification using Machine Learning

This repository contains a project focused on predicting mineral classification using a variety of machine learning techniques. The project involves data analysis, preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning.

## Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to classify minerals based on their chemical compositions, crystal structures, and physical properties. The dataset includes a collection of 3112 minerals with various attributes such as crystal structure, Mohs hardness, refractive index, and more.

## Project Steps

1. **Data Preparation:** The dataset was thoroughly examined and cleaned to handle missing values and outliers. Categorical features were encoded, and data scaling was applied for uniformity.

2. **Model Building:** Various machine learning models including Linear Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbours, and Random Forest Classifier were implemented to predict mineral classifications.

3. **Model Evaluation:** The models' performance was assessed using metrics like RMSE, R-squared, and accuracy to measure their predictive capabilities.

4. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** The Decision Tree and Random Forest models underwent hyperparameter tuning using RandomizedSearchCV for optimization.

5. **Diverse Model Implementation:** The project showcased proficiency in employing different classification algorithms to ensure accurate mineral classification predictions.
